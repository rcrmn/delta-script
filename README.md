# Delta Scripting Language

Visit [the Wiki](https://github.com/rcrmn/delta-script/wiki) for syntax and language information.


## Compiling

Currently is supported compiling with `make` and with XCode for mac.

In the future the hability to create static and dynamic libraries (and dlls) will be added, but for now only the executable-product compilation works.

The directory tree will be modified in the future to have a more "normal" structure.
